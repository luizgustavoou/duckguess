# Duckguess

## :memo: About the Project
Duckguess is inspired by the classic game "Jogo das TrÃªs Pistas," popularized by TV host Silvio Santos. This application provides a digital experience of the game, allowing users to choose from a variety of themes and challenge their friends.

This project was developed as the final submission for the Web Development 1 course at IMD/UFRN.
